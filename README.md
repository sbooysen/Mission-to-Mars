# Mission-to-Mars
## By: Stacey Booysen

The purpose of this project was to create a program that would loop and pull up the most recent articles on the Mars missions, as well as facts, and photos. By using MongoDB and Python together, we were able to create a site that was able to pull up the most recent articles and images as needed. Using html we also added some visual features to make it a little more interesting to look at.

Overall, the process came down to connecting various files, their codes, and their information to create one cohesive app.
